## **üìñ Background**
In a competitive business landscape, understanding performance trends, market dynamics, and customer behaviour is vital for sustainable growth. This project focuses on analysing sales, profit, and market performance across multiple dimensions, including annual growth trends, geographic performance, product types, and customer segmentation. By identifying opportunities and challenges, we aim to craft strategic recommendations to achieve business goals.

### **‚ùì The questions I wanted to answer through my SQL queries were:**
**1**.	How has our annual sales, profit, and sales quantity grown over the years, and are we maintaining consistent growth rates across these metrics?

**2**.	Which continents are driving the highest revenue and profit, and how can we optimize strategies for the underperforming regions?

**3**.	Which product types are driving the most revenue and profit, and how can we leverage this information to boost sales across other categories?

**4**.	Which customer types are driving the highest revenue and profit, and how can we cater to their specific needs to increase sales even further?

**5**.	Who are the top-performing customers each year, and how can their purchasing behaviours guide our strategic decisions?

**6**.	Who are the key customers responsible for 80% of total sales, and how can we leverage this insight to maximize business impact?

**7**.	Who are the high-value customers driving both sales revenue and volume, and how can we strategically engage them for maximum growth?

## **üõ†Ô∏è Tools I Used**

### **üîé KEY INSIGHTS**
**I.  CUSTOMER REVENUE CONTRIBUTION TRENDS**
1.  **The business is highly dependent on a few key customers**. The top three customers alone generate over 50% of total sales, making them the most valuable.

2.  **The top 12 customers contribute approximately 80% of total revenue**. Any significant drop in sales from these customers would heavily impact overall business performance.


3.  **Prime Stop Superstores is the dominant customer** with over 40% revenue share, meaning that any shift in its purchasing behaviour could dramatically affect company revenue.

4.   **The remaining customers (beyond the top 12) have a significantly lower impact on total sales**, suggesting that the company should focus its retention strategies on the top tier first.

### **üéØ STRATEGIC RECOMMENDATIONS**
1.  **Strengthening Relationships with Top Customers**:
-  **Prioritize retention strategies for the top 12 customers**. These key accounts should receive personalized offers, dedicated account management, and loyalty incentives.
-  **Conduct direct engagement with Prime Stop Superstores**. Since it contributes over 40% of total revenue, strengthening this relationship is crucial.
-  **Offer tiered loyalty programs**. Provide exclusive benefits for high-value customers to ensure long-term retention and increase their spending.

2.  **Revenue Diversification & Risk Mitigation**:
-  **Reduce over-reliance on a few customers**. If Prime Stop Superstores reduces its orders, the impact on revenue would be drastic. The business should aim to grow smaller customers into high-value clients.
-  **Analyse at-risk customers**. Identify any declining purchasing trends in the top 12 customers and intervene early with tailored offers.
-  **Expand customer base strategically**. The company should target mid-tier customers (e.g., Nomad Stores, ShopEase) for growth opportunities.

3.  **Data-Driven Customer Segmentation & Personalization**:
-  **Leverage sales data to identify customer preferences**. Develop personalized marketing campaigns based on historical buying behaviours.
-  **Optimize pricing and product offerings**. Ensure high-value customers receive competitive pricing and product bundles that align with their needs.
-  **Enhance customer service for key accounts**. Assign dedicated account managers to high-value customers to strengthen relationships.

-  Prime Stop Superstores alone contributes **over 40% of total revenue**.
-  The top five High-Value customers collectively generate a substantial portion of total sales.

2.  **Volume vs. Revenue Disparity**:

-  Others (e.g., Premium Stores, Surge Stores) have high unit purchases, implying price-sensitive or bulk-buying behaviour.

3.  **Medium-Value customers have growth potential**:

-  These customers could be nurtured into High-Value status with targeted strategies.

4.  **Low-Value customers contribute minimally**:
-  Many low-value customers purchase very few units (e.g., Sage Market, Cornerstone Supplies).
